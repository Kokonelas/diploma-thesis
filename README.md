Welcome to the repository of my Diploma Thesis at the Computer Engineering & Informatics Department (CEID), University of Patras.

# Abstract
Intelligent Energy Networks and Smart Energy Management represent innovative
approaches to enhance energy efficiency in building facilities. Intelligent Energy
Networks incorporate advanced technologies such as smart metering, sensors, and
communication networks for the coordination and control of energy.
Smart Energy Management focuses on implementing intelligent systems for
monitoring, controlling, and optimizing energy consumption. This involves the use of
programmable control systems, predictions, and data analyses to customize energy
provision according to the building's needs and user requirements.
These approaches contribute to reducing energy costs, improving efficiency, and
promoting sustainability. Additionally, they offer opportunities for participation in energy
networks by connecting various building facilities into an integrated system. This creates
a smart energy ecosystem capable of adapting to changing needs and conditions,
promoting the evolution toward more efficient and sustainable energy consumption.
Intelligent energy networks have several advantages, such as reducing losses by
detecting and correcting network problems faster and more effectively, enhancing
security by quickly detecting and preventing power outages, and improving the reliability
of power supply by adjusting it according to demand.
