## Abstract

This thesis explores the development and application of Intelligent Energy Networks and Smart Energy Management in modern building facilities. The goal is to enhance energy efficiency, reduce operational costs, and support sustainability by integrating smart technologies such as sensors, IoT systems, cloud computing, and intelligent automation.

**Intelligent Energy Networks** involve smart metering, sensor arrays, and real-time communication systems that allow dynamic monitoring and control of energy usage. **Smart Energy Management** leverages these technologies alongside data analysis and predictive control to adjust energy usage based on real-time needs and user preferences.

By integrating multiple facilities into a unified system, these approaches foster a flexible and adaptive energy ecosystem. The benefits include reduced energy losses, increased reliability, enhanced system resilience, and improved demand-side management.
